Seoyoung Kim: Zero-Revelation RegTech: Detecting Risk through Linguistic Analysis of Corporate Emails and News

Financials are delayed indicators of corporate quality.

Internal discussion may be used as an early warning system.

Automated platform for parsing emails and producing summary stats would be highly valuable since

* it can analyze vast quantities of textual data not amenable to human processing
* does not require revelation of individual email content explicitly to monitor

## Purpose

Explore predictive power of employee emails. Can do:

* Sentiment analysis.
* Information conveyed by structural characteristics e.g. volume of email or length.
* Other non-verbal indicators (shifting email network patterns, etc.)
