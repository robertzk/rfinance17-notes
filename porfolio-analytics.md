# [PortfolioAnalytics](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PortfolioAnalytics/index.html) tutorial

by Ross Bennett.

## Intro

Restricted to domestic equity large and midcap stocks

## Factor Zoo

Lots of factors have come out in top journals in recent years. 59 discovered between 2010
and 2012. (Harvey, Liu, and Zhu 2015)

Criteria:

* Substantiated by research
* Demonstrated historical return premium 
* Investable and defined with a systematic, rules based approach

Top are:

* Market, Size, Value, Momentum, Yield, Volatility, Quality, and Liquidty

## Single factor indexes are not all equal

Qualitative features

* Similar factor defs but unique index construction process across providers
* Different universe of assets depending on provider and parent index

Quantitative features

* Risk and return characteristics
* Caveat of reling on historical backtest data, several of the indices
  have less than 5 years of live performance data.

Spoiler: NO! Do you own due diligence.

## Missed slides

Some graphs and things on portfolio optimization I wasn't able to catch.
